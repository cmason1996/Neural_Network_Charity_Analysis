# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to take past data from Alphabet Soup's donating history and use it to train a neural network learning model that would then be used to predict whether future investments by the charity would be good financial moves. To accomplish this task that data was preprocessed and then fit to several different iteration of a neural network for the best fit to the data

### Tools Used

* Tensorflow version 2.11.0
